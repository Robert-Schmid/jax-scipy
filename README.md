# jax-scipy
Half-hearted attempt to unify jax scipy functions.
I only really support the things I need.
If anyone more qualified/motivated wants to take this project off my hands just contact me.


## Contribution
Feel free to submit pull requests to increase the coverage of scipy.
Your code should be somewhat documented, but all else is less important for now.
Some tests to insure compatibility with scipy are welcome.

Refer to [Jax Contribution Guide](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html)
for more tips. But keep in mind that this repo exists especially to collect
"lower quality" code than what would be submitted to JAX.
Maybe we get there at some point.
